# Count-down-timer
A countdown timer starts from a time you choose and counts down to zero. It shows how much time is left. You can start and stop it. When it reaches zero, it stops and can tell you time is up.
The timer lets you pick a date and time to count down to.
<br>
It shows the time left in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

-->HTML creates the page structure:
<br>
-A title called Countdown Timer
<br>

<br>
